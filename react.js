/* 
Write a Simple Counter
You can design a more complex stateful component by combining the concepts covered so far. These include initializing state, writing methods that set state, and assigning click handlers to trigger these methods.

The Counter component keeps track of a count value in state. There are two buttons which call methods increment() and decrement(). Write these methods so the counter value is incremented or decremented by 1 when the appropriate button is clicked. Also, create a reset() method so when the reset button is clicked, the count is set to 0.

Note: Make sure you don't modify the classNames of the buttons. Also, remember to add the necessary bindings for the newly-created methods in the constructor.

class Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        count: 0
      };
      // Change code below this line
  this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)
  this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this)
   this.reset = this.reset.bind(this)
  
      // Change code above this line
    }
    // Change code below this line
  increment(){
  this.setState((state) => ({
    count: state.count + 1
  }))
  }
  decrement(){
  this.setState((state) => ({
    count: state.count - 1
  }))
  }
  reset(){
  this.setState({
    count:0
  })
  }
    // Change code above this line
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <button className='inc' onClick={this.increment}>Increment!</button>
          <button className='dec' onClick={this.decrement}>Decrement!</button>
          <button className='reset' onClick={this.reset}>Reset</button>

  /* 
 Create a Controlled Input
Your application may have more complex interactions between state and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text input, such as input and textarea, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's state. The user's input becomes part of the application state, so React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.
The code editor has the skeleton of a component called ControlledInput to create a controlled input element. The component's state is already initialized with an input property that holds an empty string. This value represents the text a user types into the input field.
First, create a method called handleChange() that has a parameter called event. When the method is called, it receives an event object that contains a string of text from the input element. You can access this string with event.target.value inside the method. Update the input property of the component's state with this new string.

In the render method, create the input element above the h4 tag. Add a value attribute which is equal to the input property of the component's state. Then add an onChange() event handler set to the handleChange() method.

When you type in the input box, that text is processed by the handleChange() method, set as the input property in the local state, and rendered as the value in the input box on the page. The component state is the single source of truth regarding the input data.

Last but not least, don't forget to add the necessary bindings in the constructor.

class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        input: ''
      };
      // Change code below this line
  this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
      // Change code above this line
    }
    
    // Change code below this line
  handleChange(event){
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    })
  
  }
  
    // Change code above this line
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          { /* Change code below this line */}  <input type='text' value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange}/>
  
          { /* Change code above this line */}
          <h4>Controlled Input:</h4>
          <p>{this.state.input}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
  };

  /* 
  Create a Controlled Form
The last challenge showed that React can control the internal state for certain elements like input and textarea, which makes them controlled components. This applies to other form elements as well, including the regular HTML form element.
The MyForm component is set up with an empty form with a submit handler. The submit handler will be called when the form is submitted.
We've added a button which submits the form. You can see it has the type set to submit indicating it is the button controlling the form. Add the input element in the form and set its value and onChange() attributes like the last challenge. You should then complete the handleSubmit method so that it sets the component state property submit to the current input value in the local state.
Note: You also must call event.preventDefault() in the submit handler, to prevent the default form submit behavior which will refresh the web page. For camper convenience, the default behavior has been disabled here to prevent refreshes from resetting challenge code.
Finally, create an h1 tag after the form which renders the submit value from the component's state. You can then type in the form and click the button (or press enter), and you should see your input rendered to the page.*/

class MyForm extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            input: '',
            submit: ''

        event.preventDefault()
        this.setState((state) => ({

/*Pass State as Props to Child Components
You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.
For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.
This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.
The MyApp component is stateful and renders a Navbar component as a child. Pass the name property in its state down to the child component, then show the name in the h1 tag that's part of the Navbar render method. name should appear after the text Hello, my name is:. */
class MyApp extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        name: 'CamperBot'
      }
    }
    render() {
      return (
         <div>
           {/* Change code below this line */}
           <Navbar name={this.state.name}/>
           {/* Change code above this line */}
         </div>
      );
    }
  };
  
  class Navbar extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
    }
    render() {
      return (
      <div>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} </h1>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
      );
    }
  };

  /* 
  Pass a Callback as Props
You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.
There are three components outlined in the code editor. The MyApp component is the parent that will render the GetInput and RenderInput child components. Add the GetInput component to the render method in MyApp, then pass it a prop called input assigned to inputValue from MyApp's state. Also create a prop called handleChange and pass the input handler handleChange to it.
Next, add RenderInput to the render method in MyApp, then create a prop called input and pass the inputValue from state to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the input field in the GetInput component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the state of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the state of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.*/

    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        inputValue: ''

  Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount
React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods: componentWillMount() componentDidMount() shouldComponentUpdate() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.
Note: The componentWillMount Lifecycle method will be deprecated in a future version of 16.X and removed in version 17. Learn more in this article
The componentWillMount() method is called before the render() method when a component is being mounted to the DOM. Log something to the console within componentWillMount() - you may want to have your browser console open to see the output.*/
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        name:'Suh'
      }
    }
    componentWillMount() {
      // Change code below this line
  console.log(this.state)
      // Change code above this line
    }

  /*
  Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount
Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.
The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.
There is a mock API call in componentDidMount(). It sets state after 2.5 seconds to simulate calling a server to retrieve data. This example requests the current total active users for a site. In the render method, render the value of activeUsers in the h1 after the text Active Users:. Watch what happens in the preview, and feel free to change the timeout to see the different effects
  */

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        activeUsers: null
      };
    }
    componentDidMount() {
      setTimeout(() => {
        this.setState({
          activeUsers: 1273
        });
      }, 5000);
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          {/* Change code below this line */}
          <h1>Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers} </h1>
          {/* Change code above this line */}
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
  /* 
  Add Event Listeners
The componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.

Attach an event listener in the componentDidMount() method for keydown events and have these events trigger the callback handleKeyPress(). You can use document.addEventListener() which takes the event (in quotes) as the first argument and the callback as the second argument.

Then, in componentWillUnmount(), remove this same event listener. You can pass the same arguments to document.removeEventListener(). It's good practice to use this lifecycle method to do any clean up on React components before they are unmounted and destroyed. Removing event listeners is an example of one such clean up action.*/
